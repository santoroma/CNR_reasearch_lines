## COMPETING HIV STRAINS AND IMMUNE SYSTEM RESPONSE (2005-2009 until 2011)
<small>

Two sets of population: Viruses( HIV strains $V_\sigma$) and Immune System (CD4$^+$ T cells $X_\sigma$) where $\sigma \in S$ and $S$ a simple genomic space $S={1,...,N}$


We do not describe directly a population of infected cells, assuming that the virus dynamics is fast enough so that both population densities stay strongly coupled at all times. Finally we also assume that the mean densities are the only variable which matters, irrespective of the repartition in the body and the possible interaction with other agents  

</small>
$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dX_\sigma}{dt}&=&\frac{\Lambda_0}{N}\left(1+\frac{DV_\sigma}{1+V^T} \right) - X_\sigma\left(1+V^T+AV_\sigma \right) \\
\frac{dV_\sigma}{dt}&=&\omega V_\sigma\left( X^T - BX_\sigma - C\right) + \epsilon (\Delta V)_\sigma
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

A "predator-predator" model   $->$ The birth rates of both increase with the density of the other  

Rich dynamics from the asymmetry in the behavior $->$ Virus prey on globally while immune systems prey on specific strain

For a particular set of parameters, peaks of virus density appear in some cases as a consequence of a too high virus replication rate $->$ reminding of the clinically observed blips as a consequence of instability

## Natural Language Processing

- Use of probabilistic model like **Topic Model** and **GloVE** in order to:  

    + Select most informative documents in a corpus  
    + Detect relevant differencies between documents
    + Resolve the disambiguation
    + Perform a classification/partitioning of document sets based on their content  
    
- Have a relatively good computation performance  

- Define a standard in data preprocessing and visualization

## Extension of The Structural Topic Model (STM)
<small>  

- STM allows incorporating tags, categories, metadata and other information accompanying the text archive   

- STM uses covariate information to parametrize the prior distributions to potentially affect both topical prevalence and topical content  

- STM use the Bag Of Word approach (forget the word order in the text!)

- We extended STM so it can take into account properly multi words token (N-grams)

- from STM (Bag-Of-Word) to ExtendedSTM (Bag-of-Ngrams)  

- Technically we are acting on vocabulary matrix and updating the document with the most probable N-gram according to probablity distributions calculated using STM. doi:10.1109/ICSC.2018.00048  
  
</small>

## Extension of The Structural Topic Model (STM)
<small>  
  
- In Indexing of Anonimous Networks for Crime Information Search (IANCIS) we performed a complete crawling of four famous ToR drug marketplaces: Alphabay, Crypto Market, East India and Nucleus   

- We used E-STM to analize the dataset 

- As an example in the topic 30 (called Methamphetamine),the highest score tokens were: ice, meth, crystal_meth, shards, crystal_methamphetamine, 0.5g_crystal_methamphetamine.

- We can also see that in Nucleus (0.0218) the topic is 2 times more prevalent respect the others (0.0114)

- The coherence and the intelligibility of the obtained topics were significantly enhanced  

</small>

## Sentiment E-STM
<small>
  
- What they speaking about? -> Topic Model  

- They have a positive or negative opinion? -> Sentiment Analisys

- **Idea**: What is the opinion about different arguments not know? -> Sentiment E-STM

- What the problem? E-STM is working well with document (many sentences) while Sentiment Analisys with sigle sentence.  

- **Idea**: Divide every document in at least 3 subdocuments (negative, neutral, positive polarity) then using the $K-$ dimensional $\vec{\theta_d}$ (probabilities of sub-document $d$ to stay in topics $1,...,K$) to compute a distribution of polarity scores for every topic.  
  
</small>

## Sentiment E-STM

- In collaboration with **Piazza Copernico** Sentiment E-STM was applied to employee satisfaction survey of italian division of ENEL S.p.A.

## CircSpaceTime: An R Package for Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Models for Circular Data{data-background-image="img/wave07.gif"}
<small>  

- Currently the following models are implemented:   

- Spatial Wrapped Normal: given $Y \in R$ a random Normal variable ($f_Y(y) \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$), $\Theta = Y \; mod \; 2\pi$ in $[0,2\pi)$ is circular. Then $f_\Theta(\theta) \sim \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} f_Y(\theta+2\pi k)$  

- Spatial Projected Normal: given $\mathbf{Y} = (Y_1, Y_2)$ a bivariate vector, $\mathbf{U} =\frac{\mathbf{Y}}{||\mathbf{Y}||}$ is a point over the unit circle then $\Theta$ $->$ $U_1=cos(\Theta)$, $U_2=sin(\Theta)$. Then $\mathbf{Y}=(Y_1,Y_2)=R(cos\theta , sin\theta)=R\mathbf{U}$ where $R=||\mathbf{Y}||$
and $f_\Theta(\theta)=\int_{R^+} rf_\mathbf{Y}((rcos\theta , rsin\theta)')dr$  

- The work as be accepted and will be published on JSS Special Issue on Bayesian Statistics in the second half of 2019. For now http://santoroma.github.io/CircSpaceTime/

## Beyond E-STM
<small>  

- Time to go deep inside the model: we want to see some semantic aspects using topic model 

- The prevalence covariate Matrix $X$ is affecting only the expected value of the logitNormal distribution. The probability vector of document $d$ containing the $K-1$ topics (the last one is done!) $\mathbf{\theta_d^{K-1}} \sim LogitNormal_{K-1}(\Gamma^TX^T, \Sigma)$  
- **Idea**: Maybe the correlation between topics can dramatically change respect to specific covariates value. We want to create a correlation structure for the topics depending on covariates S $\mathbf{\theta_d^{K-1}} \sim LogitNormal_{K-1}(\Gamma^TX^T, \Omega^TS^T)$ using the same structure of the $\Gamma^TX^T$, a lasso regression, or may be an elastic (L_1+L_2)...Then there is much calculation for the full a posteriori distribution and the variational E-M to use.

- In the E-STM there is no selection between a bi-gram and the two components. We can extend this idea by introducing a discrete spatial dependence for the indicator variable $z_{n,d}$ that can become a generic compound indicator. We can take into account N-grams (contiguous words) and skip-grams (not contiguous words).  

</small>  

## Beyond E-STM
<small>    

- E-STM is working with constant sparse matrix $->$ we can go to a CUDA GPU implementation for large corpora  

- In large corpora, the number of topics can be considerable $\sim 10^3$, and we can use the correlation structure to build a network of topics. The edge can be the correlation with a lower bound. Then we can study the resulting network  

- SentimentE-STM can be used with a specific polarity database. We can use STM to select most representative documents, annotate it manually, then use STM probability structure and a word network database to an expansion to all the dictionary.
